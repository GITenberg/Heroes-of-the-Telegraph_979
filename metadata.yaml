description: Prof. John Munro (1849-1930) was the author of Heroes of the Telegraph
  (1891), The Story of Electricity (1896) and A Trip to Venus (1897). ""In plain English,
  at 4 a. m., a ray of light had been observed on the disc of the planet Mars in or
  near the ""terminator""; that is to say, the zone of twilight separating day from
  night. The news was doubly interesting to me, because a singular dream of ""Sunrise
  in the Moon"" had quickened my imagination as to the wonders of the universe beyond
  our little globe, and because of a never-to-be-forgotten experience of mine with
  an aged astronom.
